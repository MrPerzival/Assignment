# Assignment
This is assignment code given for educational purpose.
In this basics of python was used for filtering doing and solving the code as it was asked.
Here are the questions:
Problem-1
 The Indian cricket team selectors had shortlisted seven players for an upcoming tournament: MS
 Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, and Jasprit
 Bumrah. However, a few last-minute adjustments needed to be made before they finalized the team.
 Write a Python program to accomplish the following tasks using LIST.
 a) Just before they were about to announce the squad, the selectors decided to add Suryakumar
 Yadav right before Jasprit Bumrah to give him a chance to perform.
 b) After further discussions, they felt the need to add another pace bowler and decided to append
 MohammedShami at the end of the list
 c) Unfortunately, Shreyas Iyer had a minor injury and had to be removed from the team, so his
 name was taken off the list.
 d) During the review, the selectors noticed that Hardik Pandyaâ€™s name was misspelled, so they
 corrected it from Hardik Pandya to just Hardik.
 e) Tokeep things in order, they decided to sort the list of names alphabetically.
 f) Finally, just for fun, the coach asked them to reverse the order of the sorted list to see how it
 looked.
 Problem-2
 Write a Python program to accomplish the following scenario using LIST.
 Once upon a time, a mathematician wanted to teach a group of students about numbers. She decided
 to create a fun exercise using odd, even, and prime numbers. Here's how the challenge unfolded:
 a) First, she asked the students to write down a list of 5 odd numbers they could think of.
 b) Then, she asked them to create a separate list containing 5 even numbers.
 c) Once both lists were ready, the students were told to combine the two lists, creating one
 larger list of numbers.
 d) Themathematician, being a fan of prime numbers, then instructed the students to add the
 prime numbers 11, 17, and 29 to the beginning of the combined list.
 e) Curious about the size of the list, she asked them to count how many elements were now in
 the list.
 f) After reviewing the list, she decided to make a change. The last three numbers in the list had
 to be replaced with 100, 200, and 300.
 g) Whenthe students were done, the mathematician suddenly had a new idea: she asked them to
 delete all the numbers in the list.
 h) Finally, after everything was cleared, she asked them to delete the list itself, concluding the
 exercise.
 Problem-3
 Write a Python program to accomplish the following with TUPLE.
 In the mystical realm of numbers, a wise mathematician named S.Padhy found ten magical
 treasures: the first ten multiples of ten.
 He decided to pack these treasures into a tuple.
 Next, he wanted to share them with his apprentices.
--
Can you help him unpack the treasures into ten separate boxes?
 Can you also have the first treasure go to apprentice X, the last to apprentice Y, while the
 treasures in between vanish?
 Lastly, can you assign the first treasure to apprentice I, the last to apprentice J, and combine
 the treasures in between into a single mysterious collection?
 Problem-4
 Write a Python program to accomplish the following with TUPLE.
 In a land of letters, there existed a magical collection of characters forming a word:
 ('F', 'l', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'e', 'r', 'g', 'a', 's', 't', 'e', 'd').
 Acurious sorcerer wanted to perform a series of magical tasks on this collection:------
He wanted to add an exclamation point at the end of the collection.
 Extract ('b', 'b') from the tuple
 Next, he wished to transform the entire collection into a single string.
 The sorcerer was eager to know how many times the character 'e' appeared in the collection.
 He then wondered if the letter 'r' existed in the collection.
 The sorcerer planned to transform the collection into a list of letters.
 Finally, he wanted to remove the characters 'b', 'e', and 'r' from the collection.
 Can you help the sorcerer with these tasks? Write a Python program to assist him!
 Problem-5
 Given the following dictionary:
 portfolio = {
 'accounts': ['SBI', 'IOB'],
 'shares':' [HDFC, 'ICICI', 'TM', 'TCS'],
 'ornaments': ['10 gm gold', '1 kg silver']
 }
 Write a program to perform the following operations:- Add a key to portfolio called 'MF' with values 'Relaince' and 'ABSL'.- Set the value of 'accounts' to a list containing 'Axis' and 'BOB'.- Sort the items in the list stored under the 'shares' key.- Delete the list stored under 'ornaments' key.
 Problem-6
 Given the following dictionary
 marks = {
 }
 'Subu': {'Maths': 88, 'Eng': 60, 'SSt': 95},
 'Amol': {'Maths': 78, 'Eng': 68, 'SSt': 89},
 'Raka': {'Maths': 56, 'Eng': 66, 'SSt': 77}
 Write a program to perform the following operations:
- Print marks obtained by Amol in English.- Set marks obtained by Raka in Maths to 77.- Sort the dictionary by name.
 Problem-7
 Create a dictionary called students containing names and ages. Copy the dictionary into stud.
 Empty the students dictionary, as stud continues to hold the data.
 Problem-8
 Create a list of cricketers. Use this list to create a dictionary in which the list values become
 keys of the dictionary. Set the values of all keys to 50 in the dictionary created.
 Problem-9
 Suppose there are two dictionaries called boys and girls containing names as keys and ages as
 values. Write a program to merge the two dictionaries into a third dictionary.
